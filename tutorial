Addition
1+1=?Think of the question this way:U have1apple,I give u1apple,now u have2apples.1+1=2.2+3=?Think u have2apples,I give u3more,now u have5apples.2+3=5
Subtraction
2-1=?Think of it this way:I have2apples,I give u1apple,now I have1apple left.4-2=?Think I have4apples,I give u2apples,now I have2apples.4-2=2
Multiplication
Multiplication is adding something to itself.2*3=?Think2being added to itself3times.2*3=6
Divison
Think of division as dividing into groups.15/3=?Suppose u have15pears.U divide them into groups of3.U’ll get 5 groups.15/3=5 
Fractions
Tractions are of the form x/y.X is the numerator,Y is the denominator.
Factor
Factor is also called divisor. If x/y is an interger,then y is a factor of x.For example,6/3=2,so 3is a factor of6
Prime numbers
Prime numbers are numbers whose factors are 1and itself. The first few prime numbers are2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97
PF
Prime factorization is expressing a number as a product of prime numbers.Start trying with the smallest prime number and go up the list.To continue reply PFc

Finding all factors 
To find all factors of an integer,first,find the prime factorization.Then find all combinations of all prime factors.Multiply all the numbers in a combination. 
GCF
To find the greatest common factor between two numbers,we first find the prime factorization of the two.To continue reply GCFc

Then we find the common 
LCM

Adding fractions
To add fraction,u first need to make the denominators the same.
