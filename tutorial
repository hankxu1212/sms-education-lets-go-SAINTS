Addition
1+1=?Think of the question this way:U have1apple,I give u1apple,now u have2apples.1+1=2.2+3=?Think u have2apples,I give u3more,now u have5apples.2+3=5
Subtraction
2-1=?Think of it this way:I have2apples,I give u1apple,now I have1apple left.4-2=?Think I have4apples,I give u2apples,now I have2apples.4-2=2
Multiplication
Multiplication is adding something to itself.2*3=?Think2being added to itself 3 dtimes. 2*3=6
Divison
Think of division as dividing into groups.15/3=?Suppose u have15pears.U divide them into groups of3.U’ll get 5 groups.15/3=5 
Fractions
Tractions are of the form x/y.X is the numerator,Y is the denominator.
Factor
Factor is also called divisor. If x/y is an interger,then y is a factor of x.For example,6/3=2,so 3is a factor of6
Prime numbers
Prime numbers are numbers whose factors are 1and itself. The first few prime numbers are2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97
PF
Prime factorization is expressing a number as a product of prime numbers.Start trying with the smallest prime number and go up the list.To continue reply PFc

After u find a prime factor.Divide the original number by it.Then repeat the process till you reach a prime number.To see an example reply PFe
PFe
Suppose72,we first divide it by2,then2,2,3,3.Therefore72=2*2*2*3*3
Finding all factors 
To find all factors of an integer,first,find the prime factorization.Then find all combinations of all prime factors.Multiply all the numbers in a combination. 
GCF
To find the greatest common factor between two numbers,we first find the prime factorization of the two.To continue reply GCFc
GCFc
Then we find the all the common factors they have and multiply them all together.
GCFe
GCF(7,21)=?We first figure out the prime factorization:7=7,21=3*7.Then we find the common factors,which is7in this case.GCF(7,21)=7
LCM
LCM(a,b)=a*b/GCF(a,b)
LCMe
LCM(7,21)=7*21/GCF(7,21)=7*21/7=21
Adding fractions
First u need to make sure that the denominators are the same.To do this,we find the LCM of the denominators.To continue reply Fc

After you have found the LCM,multiply the numerators by LCM/original denominators.Add the new numerators together.Added fraction=final numerator/LCM
Combining Like Terms
Combining like terms work just like addition and subtraction.Find the same variable with the same power and add their coefficient together.To continue replyCLc
